Task 1 Top 5 Customers by Total Spend
- Jacob Foster had the highest total spending, a little over $8,700.
- Ethan Gomez was close behind with a little over $8,200.
- The remaining top customers were Sophia Ahmed, Lucas Hale, and Emma Young.
- It seems like a small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total revenue, which could be useful for loyalty or exclusive rewards planning.

Task 2 Total Revenue by Product Category
- Electronics generated the most revenue at around $25,000, making it the strongest category.
- Furniture placed second with just over $12,000.
- Grocery and Stationery had significantly lower revenue compared to the top two.
- This suggests that most revenue comes from only a couple of key product lines, which may indicate areas for improvement, marketing, pricing adjustments, or new product decisions.

Task 3 Employees Earning Above Department Average
- Each department had at least one employee who earned above the department’s average salary.
- This may be due to differences in experience, job level, or specific department needs.
- Examples include Farah Garcia (Finance), Maya Bennett (IT), and Alice Nguyen (Sales).
- Insights like this could help when reviewing compensation fairness, performance evaluation, and promotion planning.

Task 4 Cities With the Most Loyal Customers
- Tampa was the only city with customers who achieved Gold-level loyalty status (total of 4).
- No other city in the dataset reached Gold-level status.
- This may suggest that Tampa has stronger engagement or customer-focused strategies that could be applied to other locations.
